<p><strong>FY2022 Environmental Stewardship<br />Small Group: NIEHS Campus Bottle Filler Installation</strong><br />Marcos Flores, Derrick Vest, Eric Frails, Barry Yancey, Fred Schwartz, Steven Todd Johnson, Greg Westmoreland, Kerri Hartung, and Arrash Yazdani</p>
<p>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Office of Research Facilities (ORF) collaborated with the Health and Safety Branch (HSB) to replace dated water fountains with 43 modern bottle fillers. The goal was to reduce single-use plastics on campus, improve the health of staff, provide filtered drinking water, and increase employee satisfaction on-campus.</p>
<p>The age of the building and specifics of the construction created significant challenges and required a substantial amount of planning and engineering for some locations. In addition to the primary project goals of waste diversion and employee health, the new bottle fillers will require less maintenance over time. They are more easily accessible and can be maintained using fewer government resources than the prior aging fountains.</p>
<p>The reduction in plastic waste is substantial for an Institute with almost 2,000 staff members. These reductions help NIEHS lower its carbon footprint by lowering the amount of waste generated and reducing the number of visits needed from vendors and waste disposal vehicles. The bottle fillers include built-in meters that display the total number of bottle fills, which provides a highly visible reminder of the NIEHS commitment to sustainability.</p>

<p><strong>FY2022 Energy and Fleet Management<br />Small Group: NIEHS Decarbonization Assessment</strong><br /> Kerri Hartung, Paul Johnson, Steve Novak, Bill Steinmetz, Alexander Santago, Kyle Askins, Bill Blair, Ben Hocutt, Lee Howell, and Greg Leifer</p>
<p>As part of the Resilient-Renewable (R2) NIEHS Initiative, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) completed a Decarbonization Assessment (DA), the first of its kind for the NIH. R2 NIEHS is a holistic approach adopted by the institute in 2021, to make NIEHS more energy efficient and resilient while lowering carbon emissions.</p>
<p>The first step in the initiative was achieving a net-zero energy-renewable energy certificate designation, powering facility operations with the equivalent of 100% percent renewable resources. The next step was to complete the DA, which evaluated both energy supply-side and demand-side strategies for campus decarbonization. Strategies included better energy efficiency, climate-ready new construction, system heat recovery, electrification of the Central Utility Plant, onsite renewable energy generation, and offsite renewable energy procurement.</p>
<p>In addition, information from the DA was used to develop a Utility Energy Services Contract Preliminary Assessment, as well as design considerations for a proposed new Computational and Clinical Sciences Building. The DA provides a foundation to delve deeper into the feasibility of specific strategies, plan for future revitalization of the main research facility on campus and build a decarbonization approach for the institute that aligns with the goals of Executive Order 14057.</p>

<p><strong>FY2021 Change Agents<br />Project/Program: NIH Resilient-Renewable (R2) National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences</strong><br />Project Lead: Kerri Hartung</p>
<p>The NIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Resilient-Renewable (R2) NIEHS initiative is a holistic approach to making NIEHS more energy efficient and resilient while lowering its carbon emissions.</p>
<p>The first step in the initiative was achieving net-zero energy-renewable energy certificate status, powering facility operations with the equivalent of 100% renewable resources, approximately 25% that were carbon pollution-free. In addition, this reduced NIEHS&rsquo; Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions for FY 2021, by approximately 38% compared to the prior year.</p>
<p>Under R2 NIEHS, the next steps in FY 2022, include initiating a utility energy savings contract and a carbon neutrality assessment, laying a solid foundation for the implementation of Executive Order 14057 and ultimately carbon neutrality.</p>

<p>In FY 2021, the NIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Printer/Paper Team renewed the existing campus printer policy to enhance reduction efforts. This policy is a unique effort as the NIEHS is the only NIH facility with a strategy focused on printer and copier paper reduction.</p>
<p>Since the policy&rsquo;s inception in FY 2015, paper usage declined from more than 5 million sheets per year to just over 2 million sheets in FY 2019. This decline was driven by paper-saving efforts such as paperless work processes, business meetings, and conferences along with educational reminders encouraging staff to print double-sided, reduce font and margins, and proof documents before printing. The further decline in printing triggered by maximum telework during the pandemic can be retained as the new policy thanks in part to the foundation laid by the printer policy.</p>

<p>The NIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Green Researcher Self-Assessment (GRSA) presented researchers at the Institute with an engaging 20-minute online survey-style assessment to determine the sustainability of their individual research practices. As part of the assessment, participants had the opportunity to share sustainability related success stories from their work and provide feedback on how to improve the assessment for the following year.</p>
<p>All participants received an individual analysis of their responses and tips for additional improvement. Twenty researchers participated in the inaugural year. Three researchers achieved silver level status and seven researchers achieved bronze level status. Overall, participants rated the GRSA 4.5 out of 5 stars.</p>

<p><strong>FY2020 Wellness<br />Project/Program: NIH NIEHS COVID-19 Testing Operation</strong></p>
<p>During fiscal year 2020, if the NIH did not sustain a healthy campus, the NIEHS mission could have been severely impacted while the workforce tried to return to work in July. The NIEHS COVID-19 Testing Operations Project Team contributed to the protection of collective health, efforts to prolong life, and showed positive analytics for its health impacts to the NIH community. Because of the new testing site, employees could be on campus with confidence in their safety and well-being during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The health of the workforce is integral to the success of the NIH mission and the NIEHS was one of the first off-site Clinical Center testing operations using an outside drive-through format. The lessons-learned from that experience with shipping, testing, technology interactions, equipment requirements, and analytics improvements were then utilized at several other NIH remote sites. Through this project, the NIEHS became a leader in deploying many of the newly recommended national health recommendations.</p>
<p>The NIEHS COVID-19 Testing Operations successfully tested 641 NIH staff and conducted 2,577 lab orders for the tests by September 30, 2020. The NIEHS project expanded its testing umbrella to campus daycare staff, janitorial, onsite construction contractors, and other essential personnel who needed to be on campus every day.</p>
<p>The project was a multifaceted success in terms of many teams working as one unit in order to succeed under a very short timeline. From when the return-to-work dates were set, the project had to execute its first test on-site test in less than three weeks. Issues involving cold storage, cold shipping, testing technique, appropriate staff, building a safe site infrastructure, information technology (IT) application access, communications, and testing procedures were all solved within short timeframes.</p>
<p>The NIEHS project used efficient management practices to create a process directed to maximize employee participation in order to have the greatest wellness impacts. An innovative video explained the entire process to enhance facility awareness, employee interest, and eliminate obstacles. NIEHS experienced a very low rate of known cases within its employees and no known on-campus transmission in part thanks to this wellness project. This project is an outstanding example of how a wellness program can have significant and wide impact to a larger community.</p>

<p><strong>FY2020 Water Use Efficiency and Management<br />Small Group: NIH NIEHS Optimized Heating Hot Water Preheat and Reheat Piping System</strong><br /> Kyle Askins, James Victor Stancil III, Bill Blair, Terry Wells, Daniel Burk, Heather Davis, Joseph Shealey</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Research Facilities, Research Triangle Park, completed a design in September 2020, to convert the existing preheat and reheat heating hot water system in Rall Building 101, Modules A-E, from a constant to a variable volume pumping system. The Modules A-E heating hot water system currently consists of three 40-horsepower (hp) pumps on variable frequency drives that pump water continuously through valves at each piece of equipment. Since the valves are three-way type, the water either flows through the equipment or is bypassed, never allowing the pumps to reduce speed below 100 percent, leading to increased energy consumption.</p>
<p>This project designed the replacement of 45 control valves, consisting mostly of three-way valves near the end of their useful service life. The 45 new valves are primarily two-way valves that will open and close based on demand, causing the pumps to slow down during periods of non-peak use versus pumping 24/7 at 100 percent capacity. Eighteen in-line pumps were also included in the design for replacement with new electrically commutated motors for increased energy efficiency.</p>
<p>The reheat piping system design also included improvements to combine the Module A and Module B systems, allowing the Module B preheat system to shut off when outdoor temperatures are above 55 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, the design includes the installation of additional flow sensors and temperature sensors in the preheat and reheat piping loops to provide increased flow and energy usage data for the heating hot water system. The annual estimated savings of the project is 540,000 kWh and $32,500.</p>

<p><strong>FY2020 Green Labs<br />Small Group: NIH NIEHS Replace 15 Cold Rooms </strong><br /> The NIH Office of Research Facilities, Research Triangle Park, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, completed a project to replace 15 environmentally controlled lab rooms with more sustainable and energy efficient spaces.</p>
<p>The construction impacted approximately 2,100 square feet in Building 101, the main scientific research building on campus. All the rooms that were replaced were either not working or had unreliable climate control, causing unwanted infiltration and condensation in the units leading to mold growth and high maintenance costs. The project was designed to reduce heat transfer into the cooled spaces, reduce the amount of energy used to cool and condition the space, allow fresh air to circulate, and exhaust from the space to achieve efficient, reliable, economical, and healthful lab operations.</p>
<p>To accomplish the design plans, thermally efficient non-ozone depleting urethane foam insulation, high efficiency permanent split capacitor fan motors for the new fan coil units, and corrosive-resistant non-toxic, non-leaching welded polypropylene piping for the fan coil chilled water piping loop were installed. The new rooms also utilize digital temperature recorders that can be accessed via a USB drive instead of paper chart recorders, leading to a more sustainable way of logging room temperature.</p>
<p>These energy efficient features are being replicated in a phase two environmentally controlled room replacement project. Since substantial completion of this project in September 2020, these new rooms are projected to save 520,000 kWh per year and $28,000 annually compared to the existing cold rooms. This energy savings equates to saving the equivalent of 368 metric tons of greenhouse gases, over 62 households of annual electrical usage, 912,310 miles driven by an average passenger vehicle, or 405,112 pounds of coal burned.</p>

<p><strong>FY2020 Good Neighbor Award<br />Small Group: NIH Drain Disposal Policy</strong><br /> Paul Johnson, Timothy Adkins, Craig Upson, David Mohammadi, Roger Weidner, Thomas Carol, Crispin Hernandez, Bill Steinmetz, Carranza Smith, Antares Nicklow</p>
<p>During fiscal year 2020, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Research Facilities, Division of Environmental Protection, in collaboration with a working group from the National Institute of Environmental Sciences, developed an NIH Drain Disposal Guide that informs users about which commonly used laboratory chemicals may be released to the drain. This initiative was established to bring awareness to waste disposal including a complete guide to acceptable sanitary sewer discharges, education on the types of waste streams produced in biotechnology processes, and their appropriate means of disposal, along with accompanying instructions on how to safely discharge to the sanitary sewer.</p>
<p>The new drain disposal policy has a multitude of tools and information in order to assist the waste generator in compiling an accurate conclusion in terms of how their waste must be disposed. The policy outlines over 275 chemicals that are approved for drain disposal along with an eight-step safety protocol that must be followed when performing this action. In addition, the policy provides a decision tree to assist the waste generator with determining the appropriate means of waste disposal along with addressing liquid biohazardous waste, pharmaceutical waste and waste containing nanomaterials.</p>
<p>The intent was not only to provide a clear and concise policy and accompanying tools to assist with proper disposal, but also a means to provide clarity to the decision-making process. This enables the waste generator to understand the nature of the chemicals that make up their wastes and subsequently will result in better waste management. This policy was not only created in conjunction with the NIH environmental specialists, research community, and management, it was vetted through the local wastewater treatment authority for each specific impacted campus/location.</p>

<p><strong>FY2020 Energy and Fleet Management<br />Small Group: NIH RTP Campus Underground HTHW Piping Thermal Restoration</strong><br /> Bill Blair, Benjamin Hocutt, Lee Howell, Marcos Flores</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Research Facilities at Research Triangle Park (RTP) and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences completed a project to restore the RTP Campus underground high temperature hot water (HTHW) piping insulation. The piping system is integral for the campus buildings&rsquo; supply of steam, heating hot water, and domestic and laboratory hot water.</p>
<p>A review was conducted of the high temperature hot water system to determine viable energy saving initiatives. This led to the discovery that the drastic temperature losses in the piping were equivalent to not having any insulation at all. Two options to mitigate the temperature losses were investigated. The first option was a full replacement of the piping with an estimated cost of $30 million. However, for the second option, the RTP Facilities Management Branch team discovered a novel approach to restore the insulation by injecting a three-part expanding foam. This option could be completed for one-third of the cost of full replacement and would also reduce ground water absorption, leading to an increased piping system lifespan.</p>
<p>Analysis of the temperature losses before and after the insulation restoration was performed utilizing the system&rsquo;s calibrated temperature sensors. The resulting comparison indicated a 50% reduction in thermal losses. This equates to a reduced annual natural gas usage of 300,000 therms by the RTP Central Utility Plant and a decrease in 1,587 metric tons of CO2. The reduction in CO2 is equivalent to 1.75 million pounds of coal burned or 3,675 barrels of oil consumed. Other benefits of the thermal restoration resulted in lower soil temperatures around the buried piping, creating suitable conditions for ground cover to be established and a reduction in soil erosion and runoff.</p>

<p><strong>FY2020 Electronic Stewardship<br />Small Group: NIH NIEHS Direct Donation Program</strong><br /> Kimberly Jones, Richard Weaver, April Byrd, Kelly Powell</p>
<p>In January 2020, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) team implemented a new Direct Donation Program that has realized positive impacts on the culture of sustainability at the NIEHS and in local North Carolina communities.</p>
<p>Effective lifecycle management is required for the three million dollars&rsquo; worth of goods purchased annually to support NIEHS research. The NIEHS Administrative Services and Analysis Branch ensures timely performance assessments to monitor usage, maturity and the potential for efficiency decline for a broad range of products and equipment. Changes in programs, projects and technology create surplus assets that are no longer required in the same capacity, if at all.</p>
<p>When products and equipment are replaced, they may have not met their end-of-life expectancy and may still be operating efficiently. Each year, NIEHS generates more than 2,000 surplus items including monitors, laptops, printers, office furniture and scientific equipment such as centrifuges and shakers.</p>
<p>Under authority of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act, the NIEHS Direct Donation Program identifies high=value excess research equipment that is then donated to educational institutions and nonprofit organizations to conduct technical and scientific education and research. In the first year of this program, donations valued at more than $250,000 were diverted from landfills and directed to Duke University, North Carolina Central University, and E.E. Smith High School in Fayetteville, NC.</p>

<p><strong>FY2020 Sustainable Acquisitions<br />Small Group</strong>: <strong>NIH NIEHS Ultralow Temperature Freezer Replacement Project</strong><br /> Paul Johnson, Brian Harris, Kerri Hartung, Rachel Faison, Michael Spencer, Chris Long, Rachel Scroggins, Tom Sliwa, Kim Jones, Steven Smith</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) campus, located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, replaced 35 existing ultralow temperature (ULT) freezers with new ENERGY STAR certified ULT freezers. The current inventory of more than 400 cold storage units were analyzed to identify older, energy inefficient freezers with an inherent increased risk of scientific sample loss, elevated maintenance costs and increased operating costs.</p>
<p>Thirty-five ULT freezers, between 12 and 24 years old, were replaced and are projected to reduce electricity usage, cost, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 64 percent annually. The new units will annually save 232,896 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity (equivalent to about 20 US households), $12,809 (equivalent to the annual replacement cost of one ULT freezer replacement), and 150 metric tons (MT) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2) (equivalent to 15 trips around the world in an average passenger car). This initiative encourages the proactive annual review and replacement of aging ULT and lab grade freezers.</p>

<p><strong>FY2019 Energy and Fleet Management<br />Project/Program Team (NIH Freezer Challenge)</strong><br />Jason Williams, Leesa Deterding-(DIR/ESCBL)</p>
<p>The NIH held its first freezer challenge to reduce energy consumption from laboratory grade freezers within NIH laboratories. The inaugural challenge ran from January 1 to April 1,2019. Laboratories were challenged to adopt one or more initiatives from a set of freezer management techniques: defrost freezers, discard samples, transfer samples to liquid nitrogen freezers, maintain an electronic sample inventory, barcode samples, consolidate samples, share freezer space, retire freezers, change the temperature setting of Ultra- Low Temperature freezers from -80 &deg;C to -70 &deg;C, store samples at appropriate temperatures and to adopt room-temperature sample storage. Eight labs and one biorepository participated in the challenge. Their efforts in this challenge will save the NIH 14,975 kilowatt hours, $12,647, and 48 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions annually.</p>

<p><strong>FY2019 Energy and Fleet Management<br />Small</strong><strong> Group: </strong><strong>NIH </strong><strong>NIEHS Rail Building Chilled Water Fan Coil Loop Piping Replacement </strong><br /> James (Victor) Stancil, P.E., Daniel Burk, Kyle Askins, P.E., Brian Harris</p>
<p>The NIH Office of Research Facilities, Research Triangle Park, completed the design and construction of a chilled water fan coil loop piping replacement project in the Rail Building. This project reduced pump energy as a result of clearing flow restrictions in the piping and eliminated the risk for catastrophic failure of corroded 40-year-old steel pipes resulting in building flooding. The project used a phased approach to install the new piping while the existing piping was still in operation. The estimated annual water savings is 119,000 gallons, equivalent to 4,760 ten-minute showers or 901,300 bottles of drinking water.</p>

<p><strong>FY2019 Sustainable Design &amp; Facilities<br />Small Group: </strong><strong>NIH </strong><strong>NIEHS Rail Building Public Space Renovations</strong><br /> Alison Karver, Debra Del Corral, Amanda Thompson, Rhonda Carroll</p>
<p>While the Rodbell Conference Center Renovation Project was initiated to resolve life-safety deficiencies, it was also an opportunity to improve the overall flexibility of the Center and to renovate the Rail Building Lobby at NIH's National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). The conference facility was enlarged from a 197 to 300-person capacity that can be subdivided into three smaller spaces. These renovations and improvements encourage multi-lateral use of the space, as well as encourage on-site conferences instead of renting and traveling to offsite venues. The open storefront in the Rail Building lobby was enclosed with electrochromic glass that automatically adjusts according to the intensity of the sun, controlling heat load and glare while allowing sunlight in. The Mall Skylight Replacement Project also replaced existing single pane skylights with electrochromic glass. This dramatically improved the comfort and usability of these large central circulation spaces, and reduced heat load and glare. The projects to replace the skylights and the Main Entrance store front resulted in savings of over 40,000 KWH of energy and represent a coordinated sustainable design and renovation effort.</p>

<p>The NIH Office of Research Facilities, Research Triangle Park (RTP) and the National Institute of Environmental Sciences (NIEHS) completed design and construction of the HHS first Net-Zero Energy facility on the NIEHS Campus in RTP, NC. The project was designed to produce more renewable energy annually than it uses.</p>
<p>To accomplish this task, the project used Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) principals to minimize the amount of energy required to operate the facility achieving an 85.46% reduction in the amount of energy used by a comparable facility following minimum ASHRAE 90.1 guidelines. For renewable energy, the project installed a 120 kilo-watt photo-voltaic (solar) array on the roof generating an anticipated average of 158,614 kW-hours of energy annually over the 20-year lifetime of the system. By comparison, the annual anticipated energy consumption is only 157,408 kw-hours.</p>
<p>The facility was substantially complete and occupied in late July 2017. From August to December 2017 the facility has exceeded the Net-Zero Energy goals of the project by producing over 77,500 kw-hours of clean renewable solar energy and using less than 71,500 kw-hours of total energy.</p>

<p><strong>FY2017 Green Hero Video<br />NIH NIEHS Campus Pollinator Program Team</strong><br />Bill Willis, Bill Steinmetz, Brian Harris, Paul Poliachik, Paul Johnson, Jeff Taylor, John McLamb</p>
<p>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is a Sustainability Hero for its advanced efforts to promote pollinator habitat. The NIEHS campus, located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina,&shy;&shy; encompasses 375 acres, including woodlands, wetlands, grasslands, and a 27-acre lake. The NIEHS Pollinator Program is comprised of numerous activities and efforts working together to expand pollinator habitat on campus</p>
<p>NIEHS maintains much needed natural habitat by conserving transitional vegetation zones along the forest margins for pollinators and other wildlife and dedicated wildlife meadows as part of the North Carolina Wildlife Federation Butterfly Highway Program. Common Milkweed, a native plant that serves as a crucial survival plant for the Monarch Butterfly, exists naturally on campus but has been successfully cultivated to create a designated Monarch butterfly garden.&nbsp; The Milkweed provides food and habitat and is essential for both the caterpillar and adult stage of the Monarch Butterfly.</p>
<p>Pollinator-friendly sites for cavity nesting bees have been placed in strategic locations on the NIEHS campus. Bee blocks are heavily used by Orchard Mason and Leafcutter bees. The NIEHS also supports pollinator efforts by hosting honeybee hives as part of an EPA citizen-science project, in which scientists are researching the honeybee immune system and local hive health. Additional support of pollinators stems from NIEHS's promotion of native habitat on campus and aggressive control of invasive species.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NIEHS provides and maintains dozens of nesting areas for other pollinators, such as birds and bats as a part of the Wildlife and Industry Together (WAIT) education program. Through the region-based WAIT program, NIEHS partners with the North Carolina Wildlife Federation to increase awareness of the importance of wildlife to the environment. Education and awareness is also an important part of the NIEHS pollinator program.</p>

<p>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) initiated a number of innovative strategies that address ecological threats posed by invasive species. Along with counterparts at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), NIEHS created the Site Ecology Team (SET), a group that develops methods for protecting the 509-acre campus in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, which both agencies share. The SET protects the campus ecosystem against invasive species by monitoring lake nutrient levels, maintaining proper fish populations, improving campus wildlife habitat, and developing usage policy for the campus lake and trails. It has implemented an action plan to manage and protect native ash trees from the invasive beetle, the Emerald Ash Borer. The group has also identified and inventoried approximately 200 invasive plants and classified them by threat level. This list now serves as a monitoring tool for preventing the introduction and spread of invasive plants on campus. The SET educated NIEHS employees about invasive species through a highly successful three-part awareness series published in the institute's internal newsletter, by hosting seminars with expert speakers, and developing permanent displays. We believe these practices may serve as models for other Operating Divisions (OPDIVs) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
