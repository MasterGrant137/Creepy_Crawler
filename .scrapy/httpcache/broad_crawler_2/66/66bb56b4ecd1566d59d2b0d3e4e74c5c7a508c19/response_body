<p>Over the past two years, we supported <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2021/07/12/data-on-implementing-nihs-next-generation-researchers-initiative/">1,412</a> <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/early-stage/index.htm">early stage investigators (ESIs)</a> in fiscal year (FY) 2020 and <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2022/07/18/more-early-stage-investigators-supported-in-fy-2021/">1,513</a> in FY 2021, which were both all-time highs. These ESIs were first-time Principal Investigators (PIs) designated on <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/prepare-to-apply-and-register/type-of-applications.htm">type 1 (new)</a> R01-equivalent awards. Today, we are pleased to announce that even more ESIs were supported in FY 2022 as part of our continued <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/ngri.htm#:~:text=NIH%20has%20launched%20the%20Next,of%20the%20biomedical%20research%20workforce.">Next Generation Researchers Initiative (NGRI)</a> efforts.</p>



<p>Table 1 shows we supported an additional 1,609 ESIs in FY 2022 (a 6.3% increase over FY 2021). As there were 5,435 total applicants, this makes the ESI funding rate 29.6% (Table 2). 63.8% of the ESI applications were discussed in peer review, referred to as the discussion rate (Table 2).</p>



<p>We were also able to support 61 more At-Risk Investigators in FY 2022 (2,087) compared to the previous year (2,026) (Table 1). This group consists of researchers that received a prior substantial NIH award but to the best of our knowledge, would have no funding the following fiscal year if they were not successful in securing a competing award. Their funding rate rose to 27.0%, from <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2022/07/18/more-early-stage-investigators-supported-in-fy-2021/">25.4% last year</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Table 2: Discussion and Funding Rates for PIs on Type 1 R01-Equivalent Applications and Awards in FY 2022 by Career Stage</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Career Stage</strong></td><td><strong>Applicants</strong></td><td><strong>Discussed</strong></td><td><strong>Awardees</strong></td><td><strong>Discussion Rate (%)*</strong></td><td><strong>Funding Rate (%)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Early Stage</td><td>5435</td><td>3466</td><td>1609</td><td>63.8</td><td>29.6</td></tr><tr><td>New, Not Early</td><td>7241</td><td>3750</td><td>1257</td><td>51.8</td><td>17.4</td></tr><tr><td>At Risk</td><td>7736</td><td>4570</td><td>2087</td><td>59.1</td><td>27.0</td></tr><tr><td>Established</td><td>11045</td><td>7847</td><td>3598</td><td>71.0</td><td>32.6</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>* The Discussion Rate is a person-based metric that is the percent of applicants (actually people designated as PI’s on an application) who had at least one application make it to the discussion stage of peer review.</p>



<p>The next set of tables present aggregate data for sex/gender (Table 3), race (Table 4), ethnicity (Table 5), and disability status (Table 6). The researchers voluntarily self-reported this demographic information on their eRA profiles. Please keep the following in mind:</p>



<ul>
<li>We use the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/fedreg_1997standards">White House&#8217;s Office of Management and Budget Minimum Standards</a> for collecting and reporting race and ethnicity data (see also <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2022/07/20/what-demographic-information-does-nih-collect-on-researchers-and-how-is-it-used/">this Nexus article</a> for more).</li>



<li>These demographic data are used for statistical purposes only and not linked to consideration of funding of individual grant applications.</li>



<li>Applications are received from, and awards are issued to <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2018/05/29/waitits-not-my-grant/">institutions, not individual scientists</a>. Institutions designate scientists who serve as principal investigators on applications and awards. Thus, when we say that an application was received from a male researcher, what is meant is that an application was received from an institution who designated a male researcher as principal investigator. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>When focusing on FY 2022, there were more applications received from and awarded to male researchers than female researchers across all career stages (Table 3). We are seeing upward trends in the numbers of female ESI applicants and awardees compared to FYs <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2022/07/18/more-early-stage-investigators-supported-in-fy-2021/">2021</a> and <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2021/07/12/data-on-implementing-nihs-next-generation-researchers-initiative/">2020</a>. Female ESIs, New, Not Early, and At-Risk applicants in FY 2022 had slightly higher discussion rates, compared to males. Also, female researchers across all career stages had higher funding rates than male researchers.</p>

<p>The number of Black/African American ESIs was higher in FY 2022 compared to FYs <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2022/07/18/more-early-stage-investigators-supported-in-fy-2021/">2021</a> and <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2021/07/12/data-on-implementing-nihs-next-generation-researchers-initiative/">2020</a>. The discussion rate was lower for Black/African American researchers across all career stages in FY 2022 compared to their White and Asian counterparts (Table 4). The Black/African American group did have higher funding rates in the New, Not Early and At-Risk stages. Though progress is being made in some areas, the absolute number of Black/African American applicants and awardees remains markedly lower than white and Asian researchers.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hispanic or Latino researchers in the later career stages saw a higher discussion rate than their non-Hispanic or Latino counterparts (Table 5). The funding rate for Hispanic or Latino researchers was higher across all career stages (except for the New, Not Early group) than Non-Hispanic or Latino researchers.</p>

<p>Less than 2% of PIs in each career group reported having a disability (Table 6), which is similar to what we have <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2022/12/13/data-on-researchers-self-reported-disability-status/">blogged on previously</a>. Disabilities include hearing, mobility/orthopedic, visual, or multiple disabilities. The discussion and funding rates were generally lower for PIs who identified as having a disability compared to those who did not.</p>

<p><a>We are pleased to see the large number of ESIs continue to be supported through NIH programs. Such programs include the </a><a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2020/11/09/introducing-the-stephen-i-katz-early-stage-investigator-research-grant-program/">Katz Award</a> where no preliminary data is required, <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-188.html">Pathway to Independence Award</a> where someone can go from graduate school into a faculty level position, and <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-23-005.html#:~:text=The%20NIH%20Director%27s%20New%20Innovator,to%20the%20mission%20of%20NIH.">NIH director&#8217;s new Innovator award</a> that incentivizes early career researchers to come into the NIH system. We have made some progress, but we still have a ways to go, paraphrasing what Dr. Lawrence Tabak, NIH Acting Director, mentioned at a <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/hearings/a-review-of-the-presidents-fy-2024-funding-request-and-budget-justification-for-the-national-institutes-of-health">Senate appropriations hearing in May</a>. The <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2017/12/29/two-years-or-so-of-open-mike/">hypercompetitive funding environment</a> for instance, which was one of the reasons we launched the Next Generation Researchers Initiative, still exists and continues to affect researchers early in their career. As we move forward, our focus will remain working towards <a href="https://researchtraining.nih.gov/career/early-career">expanding opportunities</a> like these that support and prioritize researchers early in their career and further diversifying the future research workforce.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today <em>Science</em> published <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi3894">our letter</a> “Safeguarding integrity and collaborations,” which summarizes our perspectives on NIH efforts to address long-standing foreign interference threats, many stemming from foreign malign talent recruitment programs. We are grateful to <em>Science</em> for publishing our letter and for <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi8239">endorsing our efforts</a> to “talk more openly.”</p>



<p>We described our concerns in <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2020/07/08/addressing-foreign-interference-and-associated-risks-to-the-integrity-of-biomedical-research-and-how-you-can-help/">this venue on July 8, 2020</a>; we have also assembled a <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/foreign-interference.htm">content-rich foreign interference web site</a> which includes <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/foreign-interference/about-foreign-interference">case studies</a>, <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/foreign-interference/requirements-for-disclosure">disclosure requirements</a>, <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/foreign-interference/handling-allegations">processes for handling allegations</a>, <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/foreign-interference/data">data</a>, and a <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/foreign-interference/notices-statements-reports">compilation of notices, statements, and reports</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main points we make in our letter are:</p>



<ul>
<li>NIH began addressing foreign interference concerns in May 2016, long before the Department of Justice launched its entirely separate “China Initiative.”</li>



<li>We understand concerns about racial, ethnic, or political targeting. The disproportionate number of cases (which altogether account for &lt; 1% of all NIH-funded principal investigators) linked to China likely stem from the extensive reach of Chinese talent recruitment programs, which explicitly target ethnic Chinese scientists.</li>



<li>There should be no conflict between rigorous integrity oversight and international collaborations. This is a false dichotomy. As we write, “Proper collaborations do not entail stealth employment, duplicative funding, undisclosed financial conflicts of interest, or the repeated recitation of lies to institutional or government officials.” These behaviors, which deny funding to scientists who act with integrity, have often occurred at the instigation of foreign talent recruitment programs.</li>
</ul>



<p>I encourage those of you who are interested in learning more to read <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi3894">the letter</a> and to look at <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/foreign-interference.htm">our web site</a>. We are posting a <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/sites/default/files/Lauer-Valdez-False-Dichotomy.docx">longer version of our essay</a> as well as a <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NIH-Foreign-Interference-Overview-May-2023.pdf">summary sheet</a> that includes general principles, case studies, information about select publicly known cases, and findings of others (Congress, Office of the Inspector General, Government Accountability Office) who have scrutinized our work. We are continuing to work closely with Federal government colleagues to, as we write, “envision a framework that secures trust and integrity while enhancing all that robust international collaborations have to offer.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The UNITE E Committee recently updated the research community on<a href="https://www.nih.gov/ending-structural-racism/launching-new-unite-e-initiatives"> their progress</a> towards creating a “multipronged strategy to advance racial equity and create the most inclusive biomedical research environment possible.” We wanted to briefly share a few of their efforts here.</p>



<p>As a reminder, NIH <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2021/03/01/nih-stands-against-structural-racism-in-biomedical-research/">launched</a> the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/ending-structural-racism/unite">UNITE initiative</a> in March 2021 to end structural racism in biomedical research. Their inaugural progress report was <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2022/10/20/unite-co-chairs-corner-announcing-the-inaugural-unite-progress-report/">released</a> last October. One of five committees, UNITE E continues to focus attention on promoting and sustaining diversity, equity, and inclusion in the NIH extramural research ecosystem.</p>



<p>In the recent UNITE Director’s Corner message, the co-chairs Drs. John Lorsch, Ericka Boone, and Anna Ordóñez spotlighted several new UNITE-E led programs centered around:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-23-122.html">Enhancing</a> the breadth and geographical location of research and research-related activities supported by NIH<br><br></li>



<li><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-23-138.html">Purchasing</a> modern, scientific instrumentation to enhance research capacity and educational opportunities at resource-limited institutions<br><br></li>



<li><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-23-144.html">Helping</a> institutions with limited resources assess their research capacity building needs and develop action plans to meet those needs<br></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nihdeiaprize.org/">Recognizing</a> academic transformative cultures, systems, projects, and processes to promote inclusive excellence and create environments that foster and value a culture of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA)<br></li>
</ul>



<p>The following research areas were also recently cleared:</p>



<ul>
<li>Helping institutions conduct rigorous climate assessments and self-studies and develop action plans based on the results to improve institutional culture in support of DEIA</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Supporting research capacity building at resource-limited institutions in areas such as sponsored programs administration, faculty research, and institutional research policies and culture</li>
</ul>



<p>UNITE E was also instrumental for leading policy changes in requirements that recipient institutions have <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2022/12/29/behavioral-codes-of-conduct-for-nih-award-recipients/">behavioral codes of conduct</a>. These internal controls help us further assure safe, respectful, and healthful working conditions for their employees and foster work environments conducive to high-quality research, free from harassment and discrimination.</p>



<p>We encourage you to read the full <a href="https://www.nih.gov/ending-structural-racism/launching-new-unite-e-initiatives">UNITE Co-Chairs&#8217; Corner post</a> for more on UNITE E’s efforts.</p>

<p>As discussed in the blog, “<a href="https://www.csr.nih.gov/reviewmatters/2022/12/08/update-on-simplifying-review-criteria-a-request-for-information/">Update on Simplifying Review Criteria: A Request for Information</a> (RFI),” NIH issued an RFI—from December 8, 2022, through March 10, 2023—seeking feedback on its proposed plan to revise and simplify the framework for the first level of the peer review of research project grant (RPG) applications.</p>



<p>NIH received more than 800 <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NIH SRF RFI Content Analyses April 2023 508c.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responses</a> to the RFI: 780 from individuals, 30 from scientific societies, and 30 from academic institutions. The vast majority were supportive of the proposed changes, although a minority were in favor of Factor 3 (Investigator, Environment) being scored, and a smaller minority advocated for a blinded or partially blinded review process. Most of the respondents highlighted the need for strong training resources for reviewers, study sections chairs, and scientific review officers.</p>



<p>One question that often arises is how investigator and institution will be weighted in arriving at the Overall Impact score, if they themselves are not individually scored. Since 2009, when scoring was added to the review criteria, reviewers have been free to weight these as they see fit in the Overall Impact score. This score has never been an average of criterion scores. This is no different in the setting of the simplified framework.</p>



<p>Although fully blinded review may be conceptually favorable, NIH is required by statute to assess investigator and environment. Thus, at best, only a multi-staged, partial blinding process would be possible. However, as the Nakamura et. al publication showed (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/71368">eLife 10:e71368, 2021</a>), anonymization of research proposals is difficult to achieve with those familiar with a given field, with about 20% of the reviewers correctly identifying the principal investigator despite extensive redaction. In addition, while NIH is conducting a partially blinded, three-stage review process for its <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/TRA/programevaluation">Transformative Research Awards</a>, which receives fewer than 200 applications per year, attempting to scale the process up to the more than 80,000 applications is not feasible. Piloting the changes would involve designing a multi-year study, since the NIH cannot “carve out” a subset of applications submitted to the agency for potential funding and review them using a different set of criteria.</p>



<p>A trans-NIH committee has been established for implementation of the changes for simplifying review criteria. This committee is developing a timeline as well as designing rollout and trainings. The evaluation of these changes—the effects of which would be evident only over several years—will include surveys and data analysis. For the simplified review criteria framework changes, we hope to see a broader range of institution types across the scoring ranges and an increase in the diversity of the pool of R01 applicants, as well as more career stages and PI funding levels represented (meaning those with no grants or only 1 other grant).</p>



<p>If we do see improvements, however, it will be important to place them in the context of all the <a href="https://public.csr.nih.gov/AboutCSR/Address-Bias-in-Peer-Review">actions that NIH’s Center for Scientific Review (CSR) is taking</a> to improve peer review, which also include diversifying our review committees, deploying bias awareness and mitigation and review integrity trainings, and establishing a direct channel for the extramural community to report instances of bias in peer review. These actions are, of course, in conjunction with NIH’s overall efforts to break down structural barriers and advance equity in all aspects of NIH’s activities, particularly by way of its <a href="https://www.nih.gov/ending-structural-racism">UNITE initiative</a>, which has recently reached its <a href="https://www.nih.gov/ending-structural-racism/looking-forward-united">second anniversary</a>.</p>



<p>We thank all who took the time to work with us in this effort to simplify the review criteria framework for RPGs and provide feedback through the RFI and in other ways. We also thank those involved in the other aspects of improving peer review at NIH, which is an ongoing process as more data are generated and analyzed, new questions are asked, and fresh insights are established and shared. The engagement of our community partners is critical to the success of this continued endeavor. We believe these current changes will go a long way in helping us to better identify the science with the greatest potential impact.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We often recommend NIH RePORT (<a href="https://report.nih.gov/">Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools)</a> site to applicants &amp; awardees because it publicly provides reports, data, and analyses of NIH research activities, including information on NIH expenditures and the results of NIH-supported research. The RePORT suite includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>NIH RePORTER (<a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/">RePORT Expenditures and Results</a>) allows users to search for funded projects, investigators, publications, and patents (see <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2020/10/13/welcome-the-new-report-and-reporter-tools/">this NIH Open Mike blog</a> for more). REPORTER also <a href="https://report.nih.gov/faqs">includes</a> information on research projects funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Health Resources and Services Administration, Administration for Children and Families, and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://report.nih.gov/award/index.cfm">Awards by Location and Organization</a> provides year-by-year NIH funding data, filterable by institution, state, congressional district, and more.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>RCDC (<a href="https://report.nih.gov/funding/categorical-spending#/">Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization</a>) shows actuals and future estimates of annual support level for various budget categories based on grants, research and development contracts, and other funding mechanisms used by NIH, as well as disease burden data published by the CDC National Center for Health Statistics. See <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2018/06/12/rcdecade-10-years-and-still-counting/">this NIH Open Mike blog</a> for more.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://report.nih.gov/nihdatabook/">NIH Data Book</a> gives a wealth of summary statistics on extramural grants and research and development contract awards, including the organizations and researchers that NIH supports as well as application success rates See <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2019/01/24/curling-up-with-a-new-nih-data-book/">this NIH Open Mike blog</a> for more.</li>
</ul>



<p>This <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/news/virtual-learning/podcasts.htm?episode=2030">NIH All About Grants podcast episode</a> also shares ideas on how you may use RePORT throughout the grants process.</p>



<p>Though these tools provide a wealth of information about NIH biomedical research funding, RePORT does not provide information on sub-awards or non-R&amp;D contracts. Moreover, only limited data are available in the RePORTER database for other federal funders. In these situations, we encourage users to explore the following resources:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.usaspending.gov">USAspending</a> is the “official open data source of federal spending information that tracks how federal money is spent in communities across America and beyond.” Interactive tools are available to explore elements of the federal budget, such as federal loan, grant, and contract data. Importantly, it provides information on subaward data that you will not find on RePORT.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://taggs.hhs.gov/">Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System (TAGGS)</a> database provides detailed descriptions of grants, loans, aggregated direct payments and other types of financial assistance made by 11 funding agencies within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (including NIH). The grants data are at the transaction level.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/award/all">Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) / Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Awards database</a> reports small business funding made by for 13 federal agencies.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/fpdsng_cms/index.php/en/">Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS)</a> provides visibility into unclassified information on all federal contract actions using appropriated funds over $10,000, which can also be filtered for NIH.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://worldreport.nih.gov/">World RePORT</a> is an interactive, open-access database that allows users to map global research investments from various funders like NIH, the United Kingdom Medical Research Council, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, European Commission, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and Wellcome Trust. It fosters and facilitates funding analysis and visualization of global biomedical research networks, linking investigators and institutions collaborating on research projects.</li>
</ul>



<p>Except for RePORT and World RePORT, NIH is not involved with managing the other funding databases. If you have questions, please contact them directly.</p>

<p>NIH is launching a pilot on May 15, 2023, to improve the quality, accuracy, and transparency of project data for awarded NIH R&amp;D contracts&nbsp;to promote the highest level of public accountability (see <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-23-115.html">NIH Guide Notice NOT-OD-23-115</a>).</p>



<p>Six contract vendors have been selected to participate in the pilot. These vendors will directly enter select project data for their awarded R&amp;D contracts in eRA systems, replacing the process of sending the information on a PDF form 1688 for manual entry by NIH staff. The data, once approved by the NIH Contract Project Officer, will be displayed to the public through&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://reporter.nih.gov/" target="_blank">RePORTER</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://report.nih.gov/funding/categorical-spending" target="_blank">Categorical Spending page</a>.</p>



<p>The vendors will directly enter the following information in eRA Commons for projects associated with new contract awards and new task orders during the pilot, within 15 days of the request from NIH staff:</p>



<ul>
<li>Principal Investigator</li>



<li>Major Subdivision and Department Name</li>



<li>Project title</li>



<li>Abstract</li>



<li>Specific aims</li>



<li>Public health relevance</li>



<li>Use of human subjects</li>



<li>Use of vertebrate animals</li>



<li>Use of chimpanzees, and</li>



<li>Use of human embryonic stem cells</li>
</ul>



<p>The pilot will run from May 15 through October 2023 and is scheduled for evaluation from November to December 2023. The full rollout is tentatively planned for early 2024, pending results of the pilot. For resources and background, please see the <a href="https://www.era.nih.gov/recipients/submitting-data-on-r-and-d-contracts">Submitting Data on R&amp;D Contracts</a> webpage.</p>
