	<title>Toxic Protein Linked to Muscular Dystrophy and Arhinia</title> 
	<link>https://www.niehs.nih.gov/news/newsroom/releases/2023/february17/index.cfm</link> 
	<description>Researchers at the National Institutes of Health and their colleagues have found that a toxic protein made by the body called DUX4 may be the cause of two very different rare genetic disorders. For patients who have facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), or a rare facial malformation called arhinia, this research discovery may eventually lead to therapies that can help people with these ra...</description>

	<title>New 3D Model Shows How Cadmium Exposure May Affect Heart Development</title> 
	<link>https://www.niehs.nih.gov/news/newsroom/releases/2022/november2/index.cfm</link> 
	<description>Shown in the six panels is the 2D model showing how the pluripotent stem cells react to human relevant doses of cadmium over 8 days. From the control in the first panel, to the last panel, researchers can see how the differentiation to cardiomyocytes (as shown by the green fluorescent-positive cells) is inhibited with different doses of cadmium.
