Special attention is directed to the requirements for technical and business proposals to be submitted in accordance with these instructions. Also, please note that the technical proposal must be organized and presented in accordance with the "Technical Proposal Table of Contents" found in the "Specific RFP Instructions and Provisions" section/attachment of an RFP.</p>

 </p>

<ol><li>
	<ol><li><strong>Contract Clauses</strong></li>
		<li>Any resultant contract shall include the clauses applicable to the selected offeror's organization and type of contract awarded as required by Public Law, Executive Order, or acquisition regulations in effect at the time of execution of the proposed contract.</li>
		<li><strong>Authorized Official and Submission of Proposal</strong></li>
		<li>The proposal must be signed by an official authorized to bind your organization and must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFP. Your proposal shall be submitted in the number of copies, to the addresses, and marked as indicated in the item entitled "Packaging and Delivery of Proposal" found in the "Specific RFP Instructions and Provisions" section/attachment of an RFP. Proposals will be typewritten, paginated, reproduced on letter size paper and will be legible in all required copies. To expedite the proposal evaluation, all documents required for responding to the RFP should be placed in the following order:</li>
		<li>
		<ol><li><a href="/sites/default/files/ContractToolbox/techcov.htm">TECHNICAL PROPOSAL COVER SHEET</a></li>
			<li>Include RFP number, title, name of organization, name of Principal Investigator, names of other offeror key personnel, name of any subcontractor(s) and their proposed Principal Investigator(s), names of any collaborators or consultants, and indicate whether the proposal is an original or a copy.</li>
			<li>TECHNICAL PROPOSAL</li>
			<li>Format and organization of the technical proposal must follow the Table of Contents identified in the RFP, and must include the information requested in the Technical Proposal Instructions (below) and as otherwise specified in the RFP and REFERENCES. <strong>All pages of the technical proposal must be numbered sequentially and these numbers must be consistent with the information outlined in the technical proposal table of contents.</strong></li>
			<li> </li>
			<li>BUSINESS PROPOSAL</li>
			<li>It is recommended that the business proposal consist of a cover page, a table of contents, and the information requested in the Business Proposal Instructions (below) and as otherwise specified in the RFP and REFERENCES.<br wp="BR1" /><br /><br wp="BR2" />
			 </li>
		</ol></li>
		<li><strong>Proposal Summary and Data Record (NIH-2043)</strong></li>
		<li>The Offeror must submit with the business proposal a completed <a href="/sites/default/files/DGS/contracting-forms/NIH2043.pdf">Form NIH-2043</a> with particular attention to the length of time the proposal is firm and the designation of those personnel authorized to conduct negotiations. <em>(Note: A MS Word version of the NIH-2043 form may be accessed under the FORMS, FORMATS, AND ATTACHMENTS section of this website.)</em></li>
		<li><strong>Separation of Technical and Business Proposals</strong></li>
		<li>The proposal must be prepared in two parts: a "Technical Proposal" and a "Business Proposal." Each of the parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of, and concurrently with, evaluation of the other. The technical proposal must include direct cost and resources information, such as labor-hours and categories and applicable rates, materials, subcontracts, travel, etc., and associated costs so that the offeror's understanding of the project may be evaluated (See FORMS, FORMATS AND ATTACHMENTS, for format entitled TECHNICAL PROPOSAL COST INFORMATION). However, the technical proposal should not include pricing data relating to individual salary information, indirect cost rates or amounts, fee amounts (if any), and total costs. The technical proposal should disclose your technical approach in as much detail as possible, including, but not limited to, the requirements of the technical proposal instructions.</li>
		<li><strong>Alternate Proposals</strong></li>
		<li>You may, at your discretion, submit alternate proposals, or proposals which deviate from the requirements; provided, that you also submit a proposal for performance of the work as specified in the statement of work. Such proposals may be considered if overall performance would be improved or not compromised and if they are in the best interests of the Government. Alternative proposals, or deviations from any requirements of this RFP, shall be clearly identified.</li>
		<li><strong>Confidentiality of Proposal -- HHSAR 352.215-12, Restriction on Disclosure and Use of Data</strong></li>
		<li>The proposal submitted in response to this request for proposals may contain data (trade secrets; business data, e.g., commercial information, financial information, and cost and pricing data; and technical data) which the offeror, including its prospective subcontractor(s), does not want used or disclosed for any purpose other than for evaluation of the proposal. The use and disclosure of any data may be so restricted; provided, that the Government determines that the data is not required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and the offeror marks the cover sheet of the proposal with the following legend, specifying the particular portions of the proposal which are to be restricted in accordance with the conditions of the legend.</li>
		<li>The Government's determination to withhold or disclose a record will be based upon the particular circumstances involving the record in question and whether the record may be exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act:
		<ol><li> </li>
			<li>Unless disclosure is required by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, (the Act) as determined by Freedom of Information (FOI) Officials of the Department of Health and Human Services, data contained in the portions of this proposal which have been specifically identified by page number, paragraph, etc. by the offeror as containing restricted information shall not be used or disclosed except for evaluation purposes.</li>
			<li>The offeror acknowledges that the Department may not be able to withhold a record (data, document, etc.) nor deny access to a record requested pursuant to the Act, and that the Department's FOI officials must make that determination. The offeror hereby agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure if the Department has determined that disclosure is required by the Act.</li>
			<li>If a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of, or in connection with, the submission of this proposal; the Government shall have the right to use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the contract. Proposals not resulting in a contract remain subject to the Act.</li>
			<li>The offeror also agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure or use of unmarked data and may use or disclose the data for any purpose, including the release of the information pursuant to requests under the Act.</li>
			<li>The data subject to this restriction are contained in pages (insert page numbers, paragraph designations, etc. or other identification)</li>
			<li>In addition, the offeror should mark each page of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:
			<ol><li> </li>
				<li>"Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the cover sheet of this proposal."</li>
				<li>NOTE: Offerors are cautioned that proposals submitted with the restrictive legends or statements differing in substance from the above legend may not be considered for award. The Government reserves the right to reject any proposal submitted with a nonconforming legend.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
		<li><strong>Evaluation of Proposal</strong></li>
		<li>The Government will evaluate technical proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in the Technical Evaluation Criteria of each specific Streamlined Technical RFP. Cost and past performance will be addressed in each specific RFP, either as specific Technical Evaluation Criteria or by indicating what their relative importance and roles are. If past performance is not addressed, then it has been determined by the Contracting Officer that past performance does not apply to this R &amp; D solicitation as a separate evaluation factor.</li>
		<li><strong>Use of the Metric System of Measurement</strong></li>
		<li>It is the policy of the Department of Health and Human Services to support the Federal transition to the metric system and to use the metric system of measurement in all procurements, grants, and other business related activities unless such use is impracticable or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies.</li>
		<li>The offeror is encouraged to prepare their proposal using either "Hard Metric," "Soft Metric," or "Dual Systems" of measurement. The following definitions are provided for your information:</li>
		<li>
		<ol><li>Hard Metric - The replacement of a standard inch-pound size with an accepted metric size for a particular purpose. An example of size substitution might be: selling or packaging liquids by the liter instead of by the pint or quart (as for soft drinks), or instead of by the gallon (as for gasoline).</li>
			<li>Soft Metric - The result of a mathematical conversion of inch-pound measurements to metric equivalents for a particular purpose. The physical characteristics are not changed.</li>
			<li>Dual Systems - The use of both inch-pound and metric systems. For example, an item is designed, produced, and described in inch-pound values with soft metric values also shown for information or comparison purposes.</li>
		</ol></li>
		<li><strong>Privacy Act</strong></li>
		<li>The Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579) requires that a Federal agency advise each individual whom it asks to supply information, the authority which authorizes the solicitation, whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory, the principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used, the uses outside the agency which may be made of the information, and the effects on the individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.</li>
		<li>The NIH is requesting the information called for in this RFP pursuant to the authority provided by Sec. 301(a)(7) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and, as applicable, P.L. 92-218 or 95-83, as amended.</li>
		<li>Providing the information requested is entirely voluntary. The collection of this information is for the purpose of conducting an accurate, fair, and adequate review prior to a discussion as to whether to award a contract.</li>
		<li>Failure to provide any or all of the requested information may result in a less than adequate review.</li>
		<li>In addition, the Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579, Section 7) requires that the following information be provided when individuals are requested to disclose their social security number.</li>
		<li>Provision of the social security number is voluntary. Social security numbers are requested for the purpose of accurate and efficient identification, referral, review and management of NIH contracting programs. Authority for requesting this information is provided by Section 301 and Title IV of the PHS Act, as amended.</li>
		<li>The information provided by you may be routinely disclosed for the following purposes:
		<ol><li>to the cognizant audit agency and the General Accounting Office for auditing.</li>
			<li>to the Department of Justice as required for litigation.</li>
			<li>to respond to congressional inquiries.</li>

			<li>It is the offeror's responsibility to develop a satisfactory subcontracting plan with respect to small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned small business concerns and that each such aspect of the offeror's plan will be judged independent of the other.</li>
			<li>The offeror will submit, as required by the Contracting Officer, subcontracting reports in accordance with the instructions thereon, and as further directed by the Contracting Officer.

Assure that all subcontractors, other than small businesses, in excess of $500,000 adopt a plan similar to the plan agreed upon by the offeror.</li>
			<li>Assurances that the offeror (and any required subcontractors) will cooperate in studies or surveys as required and submit required reports (SF 294 and SF 295) to the Government.</li>

	<ol><li><strong>Salary Rate Limitation Information for Offerors</strong></li>
		<li>Offerors are advised that pursuant to Public Law 106-113, no NIH funds may be used to pay the direct salary of an individual through any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation at a rate in excess of <strong>$136,700</strong> as specified in the Public Law setting forth such limitations. The applicable Public Law number, the fiscal year to which it applies, and the dollar amount of the salary rate limitation may be obtained from the Contracting Officer identified in each specific RFP, if this information is not included in a specific RFP.</li>
		<li>Direct salary is considered to be exclusive of Overhead, Fringe Benefits and General and Administrative expenses. This does not preclude the offeror from absorbing that portion of an employee's salary (plus the dollar amount for fringe benefits and associated indirect costs) that exceeds the rate specified. Multi-year contracts awarded pursuant to this solicitation may be subject to unilateral modifications by the Government if an individual's salary exceeds any salary rate ceiling established in future appropriations acts. The applicable salary rate limit also applies to individuals proposed under subcontracts.</li>
		<li><strong>Institutional Responsibility Regarding Conflicting Interests of Investigators</strong></li>
		<li>EACH INSTITUTION MUST:</li>

If the Institution carries out the NIH funded research through subgrantees, contractors or collaborators, the Institution must take reasonable steps to ensure that Investigators working for such entities comply with the regulations, either by requiring those investigators to comply with the Institution's policy or by requiring the entities to provide assurances to the Institution that will enable the Institution to comply with the regulations.</li>
			<li>Designate an Institutional official(s) to solicit and review financial disclosure statements from each Investigator who is planning to participate in NIH-funded research.</li>
			<li>Require that by the time an application/proposal is submitted to the NIH each investigator who is planning to participate in the NIH-funded research has submitted to the designated official(s) a listing of his/her known Significant Financial Interests (and those of his/her spouse and dependent children): (i) that would reasonably appear to be affected by the research for which the NIH funding is sought; and (ii) in entities whose financial interests would reasonably appear to be affected by the research. All financial disclosures must be updated during the period of the award, either on an annual basis or as new reportable Significant Financial Interests are obtained.</li>
			<li>Provide guidelines consistent with the regulations for the designated official(s) to identify conflicting interests and take such actions as necessary to ensure that such conflicting interests will be managed, reduced, or eliminated.</li>
			<li>Maintain records, identifiable to each award, of all financial disclosures and all actions taken by the institution with respect to each conflicting interest for: (1) in the case of grants, at least three years from the date of submission of the final expenditures report or, where applicable, from other dates specified in 45 CFR Part 74.53(b) and (2) in the case of contracts, 3 years after final payment or, where applicable, for the other time period specified in 48 CFR Part 4 Subpart 4.7, Contract Records Retention.</li>
			<li>Establish adequate enforcement mechanisms and provide for sanctions where appropriate.</li>
			<li>Certify, in each application/proposal for funding to which the regulations applies, that:</li>
			<li>
			<ol><li>there is in effect at the Institution a written and enforced administrative process to identify and manage, reduce or eliminate conflicting interests with respect to all research projects for which funding is sought from the NIH;</li>
				<li>prior to the Institution's expenditure of any funds under the award, the Institution will report to the awarding component the existence of a conflicting interest (but not the nature of the interest or other details) found by the Institution and assure that the interest has been managed, reduced or eliminated in accord with the regulations; and for any interest that the Institution identifies as conflicting subsequent to the expenditure of funds after award, the report will be made and the conflicting interest managed, reduced, or eliminated, at least on a temporary basis within sixty days of that identification;</li>
				<li>the Institution agrees to make information available, upon request, to the awarding component regarding all conflicting interests identified by the Institution and how those interested have been managed, reduced, or eliminated to protect the research from bias; and</li>
				<li>the Institution will otherwise comply with the regulations.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
		<li><strong>Institutional Management of Conflicting Interests </strong></li>
		<li>
		<ol><li>The designated official(s) must: (i) review all financial disclosures; and (ii) determine whether conflict of interest exists, and if so, determine what actions should be taken by the Institution to manage, reduce or eliminate such conflict of interest. A conflict of interest exists when the designated official(s) reasonably determines that a Significant Financial Interest could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, or reporting of the NIH-funded research.</li>
			<li>Examples of conditions or restrictions that might be imposed to manage actual or potential conflicts of interests include, but are not limited to:
			<ol><li>public disclosure of significant financial interests;</li>

				<li>Fringe Benefits.</li>
				<li>Show fringe benefits as a separate line item. Include the rate(s) and/or method of calculating fringe benefits. Provide a copy of your fringe benefit rate or organizational guidelines.</li>
				<li>Materials and services.</li>
				<li>Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or contract line items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies, and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price. Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost analyses for all subcontracts when cost or pricing data are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part of your own cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the subcontractor cost or pricing data as part of your own cost or pricing data as required in paragraph (2), below. These requirements also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit cost or pricing data.
				<ol><li> </li>
					<li>(a) <em>Adequate Price Competition</em>. Provide data showing the degree of competition and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).</li>
					<li>(b) <em>All Other</em>. Obtain cost or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-4 ($500,000) and not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) (i.e., adequate price competition, commercial items, prices set by law or regulation or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for establishing source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary of your cost analysis and a copy of cost or pricing data submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract, or purchase order that is the lower of either $10,000,000 or more, or both more than the pertinent cost or pricing data threshold and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price. The Contracting Officer may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals in lower amounts. Subcontractor cost or pricing data must be accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime contractor's Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor's data. For standard commercial items fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked in inventory, provide aseparate cost breakdown, if priced based on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the cost or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective source's proposal. When submission of a prospective source's cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph, it must be included along with your own cost or pricing data submission, as part of your own cost or pricing data. You must also submit any other cost or pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by specific identification, along with the results of any analysis performed on that data.</li>
				</ol></li>
				<li>Indirect Costs.</li>
				<li>Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation. Where a rate agreement exists, provide a copy.</li>
				<li>Special Equipment.</li>
				<li>If direct charge, list any equipment proposed including description, price, quantity, total price, purchase of lease, and the basis for pricing.</li>
				<li>Travel.</li>
				<li>Provide the cost of travel including destination, duration, purpose, per diem, transportation, and the basis for pricing.</li>
				<li>Other Costs.</li>
				<li>List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories described above (e.g., computer services, consultant services) and provide basis for pricing.</li>
				<li>Royalties.</li>
				<li>If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:
				<ol><li>Name and address of licensor.</li>
					<li>Date of license agreement.</li>
					<li>Patent numbers.</li>
					<li>Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty is payable.</li>
					<li>Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract item or component on which the royalty is payable).</li>
					<li>Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.</li>
					<li>Unit price of contract item.</li>
					<li>Number of units.</li>
					<li>Total dollar amount of royalties.</li>
					<li>If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of specific patents (see FAR 27.204 and 31.205-37).<br wp="BR1" /><br /><br wp="BR2" />
					 </li>
				</ol></li>
				<li>Facilities Capital Cost of Money (Commercial Organizations, only).</li>
				<li>When you elect to claim facilities capital cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit Form CASB-CMF and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).<br wp="BR1" /><br /><br wp="BR2" />
				 </li>
			</ol></li>
			<li><strong>Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries.</strong></li>
			<li>The detailed breakdown shall be in a format similar to that shown on the <a href="/content/breakdown-proposed-estimated-cost-plus-fee-and-labor-hours">"Business Proposal Cost Information"</a> form found under the "FORMS, FORMATS, AND ATTACHMENTS" section of the NIH RFP Directory. For each separate cost estimate, the offeror must furnish a breakdown by cost element as indicated above. In addition, summary total amounts shall be furnished. In the event the RFP cites specific line items, by number, a cost breakdown for each line item must be furnished.</li>
			<li>Further, in an effort to assist the cost proposal review process, Offerors who have prepared their business proposal using the following software spreadsheet programs are requested to provide a copy of the cost proposal spreadsheet(s) on a computer disk (high density) along with the submission of your paper copies of the business proposal. IBM PC compatible software programs are: Excel; Lotus 1-2-3; and Quattro Pro. A <a href="/sites/default/files/DFASDocs/buscntrctprpslsprdsht08-2014_508.xlsx">pre-formatted cost proposal spreadsheet</a> is available (also available under "Business Proposal Cost Information). [Note: This is an EXCEL spreadsheet.]</li>
			<li>There is a clear distinction between submitting cost or pricing data and merely making available books, records, and other documents without identification. The requirement for submission of cost or pricing data is met when all accurate cost or pricing data reasonably available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative. As later information comes into your possession, it should be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that clearly shows how the information relates to the offeror's price proposal. The requirement for submission of cost or pricing data continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date agreed upon between the parties if applicable.</li>
			<li>By submitting your proposal, you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award. It may include those books, records, documents, and other types of factual information (regardless of form or whether the information is specifically referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing) that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
</ol><p><em>[Note to Offeror: For RFPs which are using "JUST IN TIME" procedures, the data substantiating the costs or prices proposed (i.e., payroll documentation, vendor quotes, invoice price, etc.) shall not be submitted with the initial proposal. This information will be requested from the offeror during the negotiation process. The initial proposal need only indicate from what source the proposed costs and prices are substantiated.]</em></p>

<ol><li>
	<ol><li><strong>Qualifications of the Offeror</strong></li>
		<li><em>[Note to Offeror: The Evaluation Factors for Award portion of the Streamlined Technical RFP will specify how past performance is to be treated. If past performance is a specific, weighted evaluation factor, then "Qualifications of the Offeror" does not apply. In that case, the RFP would reference the "Past Performance Information" section of the "Optional RFP Instructions and Provisions."]</em></li>
		<li>You are required to submit a summary of your General Experience, Organizational Experience Related to this RFP, Performance History, and Pertinent Contracts and Grants.</li>
		<li>
		<ol><li>General Experience</li>
			<li>General experience is defined as general background, experience and qualifications of the offeror. A discussion of proposed facilities which can be devoted to the project may be appropriate.</li>
			<li>Organizational Experience Related to the RFP</li>
			<li>Organizational experience is defined as the accomplishment of work, either past or on-going, which is comparable or related to the effort required by this RFP. This includes overall offeror or corporate experience, but not the experience and/or past performance of individuals who are proposed as personnel involved with the Statement of Work in this RFP (the evaluation of proposed personnel will be done through the applicable technical evaluation criterion).</li>
			<li>Performance History</li>
			<li>Performance history is defined as meeting contract objectives within delivery and cost schedules on efforts, either past or on-going, which are comparable or related to the effort required by this RFP.</li>
			<li>Pertinent Contracts</li>
			<li>Pertinent contracts is defined as a listing of each related contract completed within the last three years or currently in process. List contracts awarded by the Government that involved similar or related work to that called for in this RFP. Include the contract number, contracting agency, contract dollar value, dates contract began and ended (or ends), description of contract work, explanation of relevance of work to this RFP, names and telephone numbers of the Contract Specialist and the Health Science Administrator.</li>
			<li>Pertinent Grants</li>
			<li>Pertinent grants is defined as a listing of each related grant completed within the last three years or currently in process. List grants supported by the Government that involved similar or related work to that called for in this RFP. Include the grant number, involved agency, names and telephone numbers of the Grant Specialist and the Health Science Administrator, identification of the work, and when performed.</li>
			<li>You are cautioned that omission of the above information or an inadequate or inaccurate response to this very important RFP requirement could have a negative effect on the overall selection process. Experience and past performance are relevant to the ability of the offerors to perform and, while not a specific, weighted evaluation factor they are inherent in one or more technical evaluation criterion. Also, they may be used to conduct a relative assessment of offerors during the source selection process if the Evaluation Factors for Award in the specific RFP so indicates.<br wp="BR1" /><br /><br wp="BR2" />

		</ol></li>
		<li><strong>Property, Equipment, Facilities</strong></li>
		<li>
		<p> </p>

		<p> </p>

		<ol><li>It is DHHS policy that Contractors will provide all equipment and facilities necessary for performance of contracts. Exception may be granted to furnish Government-owned property, or to authorize purchase with contract funds, only when approved by the Contracting Officer. If the offeror is proposing that the Government provide any equipment, other than that specified under Government Furnished Property in the RFP, the proposal must include comprehensive justification which includes, in addition to the description and estimated cost of each item:
			<ol><li>An explanation that the item is for a special use essential to the direct performance of the contract and the item will be used exclusively for the purpose. Office equipment such as desks, office machines, etc., will not be provided under a contract except under very exceptional circumstances.</li>
				<li>No practical or economical alternative exists (e.g., rental, capital investment) that can be used to perform the work.<br /><br wp="BR1" /><br /><br wp="BR2" />
				 </li>
			</ol></li>
			<li>The offeror shall identify Government-owned property in its possession and/or Contractor titled property acquired from Federal funds, which it proposes to use in the performance of the prospective contract.</li>
			<li>If an offeror intends to use existing Government-owned facilities in the performance of this proposed contract, the following shall be furnished with the offer: (1) Description and value of all Government production and research property which the offeror or his/her anticipated subcontractors propose to use on a rent-free basis and the cognizant Government Contract Number; (2) Written permission of the Contracting Officer having cognizance of the property for use of that property without charges; (3) Amount of use (in months) to be made of such property, and (4) Amount of rent which would otherwise be charged for such use, computed in accordance with applicable procurement regulations.</li>
			<li>The management and control of any Government property shall be in accordance with DHHS Publication (OS) 686 entitled, "Contractor's Guide for Control of Government Property (1990)," a copy of which will be provided upon request.<br /><br wp="BR1" /><br /><br wp="BR2" />
			 </li>
		</ol></li>
		<li><strong>Royalties</strong></li>
		<li>The offeror shall furnish information concerning royalties which are anticipated to be paid in connection with performance of work under the proposed contract.</li>
		<li><strong>Submission of Electronic Funds Transfer Information with Offer, FAR Clause 52.232-38 (MAY 1999)</strong></li>
		<li>The offeror shall provide, with its offer, the following information that is required to make payment by electronic funds transfer (EFT) under any contract that results from this solicitation. This submission satisfies the requirement to provide EFT information under paragraphs (b)(1) and (j) of the clause at 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Other than Central Contractor Registration.</li>
		<li>
		<ol><li>(1) The solicitation number (or other procurement identification number). (2) The offeror's name and remittance address, as stated in the offer. (3) The signature (manual or electronic, as appropriate), title, and telephone number of the offeror's official authorized to provide this information. (4) The name, address, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the offeror's financial agent. (5) The offeror's account number and the type of account (checking, savings, or lockbox). (6) If applicable, the Fedwire Transfer System telegraphic abbreviation of the offeror's financial agent. (7) If applicable, the offeror shall also provide the name, address, telegraphic abbreviation, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the correspondent financial institution receiving the wire transfer payment if the offeror's financial agent is not directly on-line to the Fedwire and, therefore, not the receiver of the wire transfer payment.</li>
		</ol></li>
		<li><strong>Financial Capacity</strong></li>
		<li>The offeror shall indicate if it has the necessary financial capacity, working capital, and other resources to perform the contract without assistance from any outside source. If not, indicate the amount required and the anticipated source.</li>
		<li><strong>Incremental Funding</strong> --(Note: This is applicable if the RFP has stated that the contract resulting from this solicitation will be incrementally funded.)</li>
		<li>An incrementally funded cost-reimbursement contract is a contract in which the total work effort is to be performed over a multiple year period and funds are allotted, as they become available, to cover discernible phases or increments of performance. The incremental funding technique allows for contracts to be awarded for periods in excess of one year even though the total estimated amount of funds expected to be obligated for the contract are not available at the time of the contract award. If this requirement is specified elsewhere in this RFP, the offeror shall submit a cost proposal for each year. In addition, the following provisions are applicable:</li>
		<li>Sufficient funds are not presently available to cover the total cost of the complete multiple year project described in this solicitation. However, it is the Government's intention to negotiate and award a contract using the incremental funding concepts described in the clause entitled "Limitation of Funds." Under that clause, which will be included in the resultant contract, initial funds will be obligated under the contract to cover an initial period of performance. Additional funds are intended to be allotted from time to time, to the contract by contract modification, up to and including the full estimated cost of the contract, to accomplish the entire project. While it is the Government's intention to progressively fund this contract over the entire period of performance up to and including the full estimated cost, the Government will not be obligated to reimburse the Contractor for costs incurred in excess of the periodic allotments, nor will the Contractor be obligated to perform in excess of the amount allotted.</li>
		<li><strong>Subcontractors</strong></li>
		<li>If subcontractors are proposed, please include a commitment letter from the subcontractor detailing:
		<ol><li>Willingness to perform as a subcontractor for specific duties (list duties).</li>
			<li>What priority the work will be given and how it will relate to other work.</li>
			<li>The amount of time and facilities available to this project.</li>
			<li>Information on their cognizant field audit offices.</li>
			<li>How rights to publications and patents are to be handled.</li>
			<li>A complete cost proposal in the same format as the offeror's cost proposal.<br /><br wp="BR1" /><br /><br wp="BR2" />
			 </li>
		</ol></li>
		<li><strong>Representations and Certifications</strong></li>
		<li>One copy of the <a href="/sites/default/files/DGS/contracting-forms/sectionk_508.pdf">Representations and Certifications</a> (link to RFP REFERENCES) shall be completed and be signed by an official authorized to bind your organization. Additionally, a completed copy of the Representations and Certifications shall be submitted from any proposed subcontractor.</li>
		<li>Travel Policy and Annual Report</li>
		<li>The Proposer's Travel Policy and Annual Report are two items that will be requested of offerors in the competitive range, offerors who submit FRPs, or offerors who will receive an award (i.e., "Just in Time"), rather than of all offerors with their initial business proposals. <em>(Note: In cases where the RFPs specifically state that awards may be made without discussions, offerors must submit these documents with their initial business proposal.)</em></li>
	</ol></li>
</ol><p>NOTE: If additional "Just in Time" items are selected from the Optional Instructions and Provisions, then the RFP will so indicate. A <a href="/sites/default/files/DFASDocs/buscntrctprpslsprdsht08-2014_508.xlsx">pre-formatted cost proposal spreadsheet</a> is available (also available under "Business Proposal Cost Information).
